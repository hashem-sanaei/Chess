# Chess Game

This is a Java-based chess game that supports both player vs player and player vs AI modes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several packages:

- [`CHESSS/board`](CHESSS/board): Contains the `Board.java` and `Move.java` classes which represent the chess board and the moves that can be made.
- [`CHESSS/frame`](CHESSS/frame): Contains various classes for the game's graphical user interface.
- [`CHESSS/game`](CHESSS/game): Contains the `Game.java` class which is the main class that controls the game logic.
- [`CHESSS/Pieces`](CHESSS/Pieces): Contains classes for each type of chess piece.
- [`CHESSS/project`](CHESSS/project): Contains classes related to the AI player and game logic.

## Main Features

- **Board and Moves**: The game includes a representation of a chess board and the moves that can be made by the pieces.
- **Graphical User Interface**: The game has a graphical user interface that allows players to interact with the game.
- **Player vs Player and Player vs AI Modes**: The game supports both player vs player and player vs AI modes.
- **Chess Pieces**: The game includes classes for each type of chess piece, each with its own set of possible moves.

## How to Run

To run the game, compile and run the `Main.java` file.

## Note

The project ignores certain files such as compiled class files, log files, and package files. See the [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) file for more details.

## Future Improvements

- Improve the AI player's strategy.
- Add the ability to save and load games.
- Improve the user interface.
